    I'm a steady rollin' man, I roll both night and day
    I'm a steady rollin' man, I roll both night and day
    But I haven't got no sweet woman, boys, to be rollin' this way
    
    I'm the man that rolls when icicle's hangin' on the tree
    I'm the man that rolls when icicle's hangin' on the tree
    And now you hear me howlin', baby, down on my bended knee
    
    I'm a hard workin' man, have been for many years, I know
    I'm a hard workin' man, have been for many long years, I know
    And some cream puff's usin' my money, Ooh, babe but that'll never be no more
    
    You can't give your sweet woman, Everything she wants in one time
    Ooh ooh, you can't give your sweet woman, Everything she wants in one time
    Well, boys, she get ramblin' in her brain, Some monkey man on her mind
    
    I'm a steady rollin' man, I roll both night and day
    I'm a steady rollin' man and I roll both night and day
    Well, I don't have no sweet woman, boys, to be rollin' this way
