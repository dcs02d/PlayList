When John Henry was a little babe
A-holding to his mama's hand
Says, "If I live till I'm 21
I'm going to make a steel-driving man, my babe
I'm going to make a steel-driving man"

When John Henry was a little boy
A-sitting on his father's knee
Says, "The Big Bend Tunnel on the C&O Road
Is going to be the death of me, my babe"

John he made a steel-driving man
They took him to the tunnel to drive

He drove so hard he broke his heart
He laid down his hammer and he died, my babe

O now John Hardy is a steel-driving man
He belongs to the steel-driving crew
And every time his hammer comes down
You can see that steel walking through

The steam drill standing on the right-hand side
John Henry standing on the left

He says, "I'll beat that steam drill down
Or I'll die with my hammer in my breast"

He placed his drill on the top of the rock
The steam drill standing close at hand

He beat it down one inch and a half
And laid down his Hammer like a man

Johnny looked up to his boss-man and said
"O boss-man, how can it be?
For the rock is so hard and the steel is so tough
I can feel my muscles giving way"

Johnny looked down to his turner and said
"0 turner, how can it be?
The rock is so hard and the steel is so tough
That everybody's turning after me"

They took poor Johnny to the steep hillside
He looked to his heavens above

He says, "Take my hammer and wrap it in gold
And give it to the girl I love"

They took his hammer and wrapped it in gold And gave it to Julia Ann
And the last word John Hardy said to her Was, "Julia, do the
best you can"

If I die a railroad man
Go bury me under the tie
So I can hear old Number Four
As she goes rolling by

If I die a railroad man
Go bury me under the sand
With my pick and shovel at my head and feet
And a nine-pound hammer in my hand
