    On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
    G                               D
    They call me by a number not a name Lord Lord
    C                            G
    Gotta do my time gotta do my time
                   D7                  G
    With an aching heart and a worried mind

    When that old judge looked down and smiled
    Said I'll put you on that good road for a while Lord Lord
    Gotta do my time gotta do my time
    With an aching heart and a worried mind

<!-- Second  column -->
<td><pre>
    
    You can hear my hammer you can hear my song
    I'm gonna swing it like John Henry all day long Lord Lord
    Gotta do my time gotta do my time
    With an aching heart and a worried mind
    
    It won't be long just a few more days
    I'll settle down and quit my rowdy ways Lord Lord
    With that gal of mine with that gal of mine
    She'll be waitin' for me when I've done my time
