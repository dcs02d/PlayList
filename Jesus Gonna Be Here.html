    intro: Dm
                      Dm
    Well, Jesus gonna be here
    
    Gonna be here soon
    
    he's gonna cover us up with leaves
                            A7
    With a blanket from the moon
           Dm
    With a promise and a vow
          Gm        
    And a lullaby for my brow
                Dm      A7 
    Jesus gonna be here
                  Dm
    gonna be here soon
    
    Well I'm just gonna do nothin' but wait here
    I don't have to shout
    I got no reason and
    And I got no doubt
    I'm gonna get myself unfurled
    From this mortal coiled up world
    Jesus gonna be here
    Gonna be here soon

<!-- Second  column -->
<td><pre>

    I got to keep my eyes open
    So I can see my Lord
    I'm gonna watch the horizon
    For a brand new Ford
    
    I can hear him rolling on down the lane
    I said Hollywood be thy name
    Jesus gonna be
    Gonna be here soon
    
    Well I gotta keep myself faithful
    And you know I've been so good
    Except for drinking
    But he new that I would
    I'm gonna leave this place better
    Than the way I found it was
    And Jesus gonna be here
    Gonna be here soon
