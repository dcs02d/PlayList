The smokestack's spitting black soot into the sooty sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the Indian's eye
The Elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The Ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage

God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah         


The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawling out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care   Come on!    Ahah

God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah

The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger let me tell you gave us quite a scare

God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah

The kids flip their lids when their ids hear that crazy sound
Their neighbour digs the flavour still he's moving to another town
And I don't believe he'll come back

God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah
God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah

And I don't know how you're taking all the shit you see

You don't believe anyone but most of all don't believe me
God damn right it's a beautiful day Ahah - x4
