    They're gonna put me in the movies
    They're gonna make a big star out of me
    We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
    And all I gotta do is act naturally

    Well, I'll bet you I'm a-gonna be a big star
    Might win an Oscar you can't never tell
    The movie's gonna make me a big star,
    'Cause I can play the part so well

    Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
    Then I'll know that you will plainly see
    The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
    And all I gotta do is act naturally

</pre></td>
<!-- first column -->

<!-- Second  column -->
<td><pre>

    We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely
    Begging down upon his bended knee
    I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
    All I'll have to do is act naturally

    Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
    Then I'll know that you will plainly see
    The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
    And all I gotta do is act naturally
