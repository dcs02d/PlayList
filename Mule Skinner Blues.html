    Good mornin' Captain
    Good mornin' Shine
    Do you need another mule skinner
    Out on your new mud line?
    Yo-del-lay-ee-ee, yo-del-lay-ee-ee-ee
    
    Well, I'm a lady mule skinner
    From down old Tennessee way
    Hey, hey, I come from Tennessee
    I can make any mule listen
    Or I won't accept your pay
    Hey, hey, I won't take your pay
    
    Hey, little water boy
    Bring that water round
    If you don't like your job
    Set that water bucket down
    Yo-del-lay-ee-ee, yo-del-lay-ee-ee

    Well, I've been working down in Georgia
    At a greasy spoon cafe
    Hey, I've been working in Georgia
    Just to let a no good man
    Call every cent of my pay
    Yo-del-lay-ee-ee, yo-del-lay-ee-ee
    
    I'm going to town, honey
    What you want me to bring you back?
    Bring a pint of booze
    And a John B. Stetson hat, bring it comin' honey
    Yo-del-lay-ee-ee, yo-del-lay-ee-ee

    I smell your bread a burnin'
    Turn your damper down
    If you ain't got a damper
    Good gal, turn your bread around
    Yo-del-lay-ee-ee, yo-del-lay-ee-ee
