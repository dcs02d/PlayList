    <h2>Freight Train </h2>

    "Freight Train" is an American folk song written by Elizabeth Cotten  (January 5, 1893 - June 29, 1987)in the early 20th century, and popularized during the American folk 
    revival and British skiffle[1] period of the 1950s and 1960s. By Cotten's own account in the 1985 BBC series Down Home, she composed 
    “Freight Train” as a teenager (sometime between 1906 and 1912), inspired by the sound of the trains rolling in on the tracks near her home in North Carolina.

    Her signature alternating bass style has become known as "Cotten picking".
