    Baby, do me a favor, keep our business to yourself.
    Please, darling, do me a favor, keep our business to yourself.
    I don't want you to tell nobody in your family,
    And don't mention it to nobody else.

    Don't tell your mother,  Don't tell your father, Don't tell your sister,        
       Don't mention it to your brother,
    Please, darling, keep our business to yourself.
    Don't you tell nobody,
    And don't mention it to nobody else.

    Baby, do me a favor, keep our business to yourself.
    Please, darling, do me a favor, keep our business to yourself.      
    I don't want you to tell nobody in your family,
    And don't mention it to nobody else. 
    
    You have a husband, I have a wife, If you start to talking,
        That's gonna mess up our life,
    Please, please baby, keep our business to yourself.
    Don't you tell nobody,
    And don't mention it to nobody else.
    Goodbye darling.
