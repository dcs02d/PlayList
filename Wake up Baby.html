    I come home one night
    I was tired as I could be
    I saw a mule in my stable
    Where my mule supposed to be?
    
    Wake up, baby
    And explain all this stuff to me
    Who's mule is that in my stable
    Where my mule supposed to be?
 
    You must be silly
    You talk right funny
    Why don't you open up your eyes and see
    You know that ain't nothing but a milk cow
    That my mother sent to me
    I've been all over the world, Tucufa?, Mexico
    I never, saw no milk cow with a saddle on his back before
    
    Next night when I come home
    I was as tired as a man could be
    I saw a hat on the dresser
    Where my hat supposed to be?

I said wake up, Darlin'
And explain this stuff to me
Who's hat is on my dresser
Where is my hat supposed to be?
She said you must be silly, Daddy you ain't talking right
Why don't you open up your eyes and see
You know that ain't nothing but a wife's vane  that my grandmother sent to me
I've been all over the world, Tucufa, Mexico
You know I never saw no wife's vane with a hat band around it before


Next night when I come home
I was as tired as a man could be
I saw a coat on my hanger
Where my coat supposed to be?


I said wake up, little girl
And explain all this stuff to me
Who's coat is on my hangar
Where is my coat supposed to be?
She said Daddy you talk right silly
Why don't you open up your eyes and see
You know that ain't nothing but a blanket that my mother sent to me
I've been all over the world, [Tucufa?}, Mexico
I never saw no blanket with a with two sleeves and them before
