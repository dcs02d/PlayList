    Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
    Oh what a couple in love
    Swore to be true to each other
    True as the stars above
    He was her man but he done her wrong

    Frankie went down to the corner
    A bucket of beer to buy
    The bartender told her that Johnny
    Was making love to Nellie Bly
    He was her man he was doing her wrong

    Frankie went home in a hurry
    She didn’t go there for fun
    Frankie went home just to get a hold
    Of her own .44
    He was her man but he done her wrong

    Frankie peeked in on the party
    She got a surprise when she saw
    Nellie and Johnny making love
    Sipping something through a straw
    She caught her man, he was doing her wrong

    Johnny in a panic mounted the staircase
    Screaming ‘Oh, Frankie please don’t do it!’
    She pulled that trigger and rooty-toot-toot
    Three times she did shoot
    He was her man but he done her wrong

    Now bring ‘round your crêpe and your flowers
    Bring round your rubber-tired hack
    Taking my man to the graveyard
    I ain’t gonna bring him back
    He was my man but he done me wrong

    This story has no moral
    And this story has got no end
    This story just goes to show you women
    That there ain’t no good in men
    He was her man but he done her wrong
