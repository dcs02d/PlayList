    "You Gotta Move" is a traditional African-American spiritual song. 
    Since the 1940s, the song has been recorded by a variety of gospel musicians, usually as "You Got to Move" or "You've Got to Move". 
    It was later popularized with blues and blues rock secular adaptations by Mississippi Fred McDowell and the Rolling Stones.

    You gotta move
    You gotta move
    You gotta move, child
    You gotta move
    Oh, when the Lord get ready
    You gotta move

    You may be high
    You may be low
    You may be rich, child
    You may be poor
    But when the Lord get ready
    You gotta move

    You see that woman
    Who walks the street
    You see that police
    Upon his beat
    But then the Lord get ready
    You gotta move
