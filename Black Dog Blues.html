    Let me tell you, mama, what that black dog done done to Me
    He cheated me from my regular, now he's after my used-to-Be

    Black dog, black dog, you caused me to weep and moan
    Black dog, black dog, you caused me to weep and moan
    You cause me to leave my, sweet old happy home

    Black dog, black dog, you forever on my mind
    Black dog, black dog, you forever on my mind
    If you only let me see my baby one more time

    So long black dog, I'm quittin' your hard luck line

    'cause you got me so blue, keep 'bout to love her Sometime
