    Oh listen to the train coming down the line
    Trying to make up all of her lost time
    From Buffalo to Washington
    
    You can wash my jumper
    Starch my overalls
    Catch the train they call the Cannonball
    From Buffalo to Washington
    
    Yonder comes the train
    Coming down the track
    Carry me away
    But it ain't gonna carry me back
    My honey babe my blue eyed babe

<!-- Second  column -->
<td><pre>

    My baby's left me she even took my shoes
    Enough to give a man
    These doggoned worried blues
    She's gone she's solid gone
    
    I'm going up north
    I'm going up north this fall
    If luck don't change I won't be back at all     
    My honey babe I'm leaving you
