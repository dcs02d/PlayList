    If you go down to Deep Elem
    Just to have a little fun,
    You'd better have your fifteen dollars
    When the policeman come.
    Oh, sweet mama, daddy's got the Deep Elem Blues
       

    If you go down to Deep Elem,
    Keep your money in your shoes;
    The women in Deep Elem
    Got those Deep Elem blues.
    Oh, sweet mama, daddy's got the Deep Elem Blues

    If you go down to Deep Elem,
    Take your money in your pants;
    The women in Deep Elem
    Never give the men a chance.
    Oh, sweet mama, daddy's got the Deep Elem Blues

    Now I once knew a preacher,
    Preached the Bible through and through,
    He went down into Deep Elem,
    Now his preaching days are through.
    Oh, sweet mama, daddy's got the Deep Elem Blues     
    
    Now I once had a sweet gal,
    Lord, she meant the world to me;
    She went down into Deep Elem;
    She ain't what she used to be.
    Oh, sweet mama, daddy's got the Deep Elem Blues

    Her papa's a policeman
    And her mama walks the street;
    Her papa met her mama
    When they both were on the beat.
    Oh, sweet mama, daddy's got the Deep Elem Blues
