    There is a house in New Orleans
          Am       C      E
    They call the "Rising Sun"
             Am       C       D           F
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    Am     E         | Am | C | D | F | Am | E | Am | E |
    And God, I know, I'm one                
    
    My mother was a tailor 
    She sewed my new blue jeans 
    My father was a gambling man
    Down in New Orleans.     
    
    Now the only thing a gambler needs 
    Is a suitcase and a trunk 
    And the only time, he's satisfied,
    Is when he's on a drunk

    O, mother, tell your children
    Not to do what I have done
    Spend your lives in sin and misery
    In the House of Rising Sun          
    
    Well, I got one foot on the platform 
    The other foot on the train 
    I'm going back to New Orleans 
    To wear that ball and chain          
    
    Well, there is a house in New Orleans 
    They call the "Rising Sun"  
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    And God, I know, I'm one
