<!-- first column -->
<pre>            

Bring me my pistol, three rounds of ball
I'm gonna kill everybody that I don't like at all
Like at all, like at all
Like at all, like at all

On a Monday I was arrested, on a Tuesday I was tried
And the judge found me guilty and I hung my head and cried
Lord, and cried, Lord, and cried, Lord, and cried, Lord, and cried


</pre></td>
<!-- first column -->

<!-- Second  column -->
<td><pre>

I asked the judge what would be my fine
A pick and a shovel way down Joe Brown's coal mine.
Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine

I gotta 38 special, and 45 frame
How can you do this 'cause I got dead aim
Got dead aim, got dead aim
Got dead aim, got dead aim
