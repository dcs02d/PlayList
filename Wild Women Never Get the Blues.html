    Well these women always ravin' 'bout their monkey men,  
     G(m)                   G0    G(m)              G0

    Peaceful women sit around all day and moan.

    Wild women don't worry, wild women don't get the blues.  
    
    Well, I got a disposition, and a way of my own,  
    If my man don't like it, he can find a new home.  
    I go out and drink good whiskey, walk the streets all night,  
    Then I go home and kick my man out if he don't do me right.  
    'Cause wild women don't worry, wild women don't get the blues.

    Well, you never get nothin' by bein' an angel child  
    Girls you better change your ways of living, and  get real wild.  
    I wanna tell you somethin' you know I wouldn't tell you no lie.  
    Wild women are the only kind that ever get by.  
    'Cause wild women don't worry, wild women don't get the blues.
