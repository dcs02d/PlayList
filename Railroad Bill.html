    He never worked, and he never will,
              C     G    C
    and it's ride, ride, ride.
    
    Railroad Bill, he ain't so bad,
    killed his momma, shot a round in his dad
    Ride old Railroad Bill.
    
    Railroad Bill done took my wife.
    If I'd said a word, he'd have taken my life
    And it’s Ride old Railroad Bill.
    
    Railroad Bill he was comin' down the hill
    Lightin' cigars with a ten-dollar bill
    Ride old Railroad Bill
    
    Ten policemen, all dressed in black,
    coming out of nowhere, walking down the tracks,
    and they're looking for Railroad Bill
    
    Railroad Bill, comin' round the fence
    Robbin' a passenger train for 16 cents
    I'm gonna ride old Railroad Bill

    Railroad Bill got in a gamblin' game
    shot a man down, though he was to blame
    when you lose your mind, just let it loose
    
    Railroad Bill he's a mighty bad man
    Shot the lantern from a brakeman's hand
    Just to see that man suffer pain.

    Got a great long pistol, 'bout as long as your arm,
    I'm gonna shoot everybody ever done me harm
    And it’s ride, Bill, ride.

    Got a .38 special on a .45 frame.
    How can I miss when I got dead aim
    Ride, ride, ride.
     
    Gonna drink my whiskey, gonna drink it in the wind
    The doctor said it'd kill me, but he didn't say  when,
    And it’s ride Old Railroad Bill
    
    Going up on the mountain, going out west.
    Thirty eight special sticking out of my vest.
    Ride, ride Bill Ride.
