    Then I began to fall so low
    I didn't have a friend and no place to go
    So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again
    I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's grin

    Nobody knows you
    When you're down and out
    In my pocket not one penny
    And my friends, I haven't any
    
    But if I ever get on my feet again
    Then I'll meet my long lost friend
    It's mighty strange without a doubt
    Nobody knows you when you're down and out
