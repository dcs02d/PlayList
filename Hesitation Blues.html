The eagle on the dollar says "in God we trust"
You say you want a man
You want to see that dollar first
Tell me how long do I have to wait?
Can I get you now, I said, must I hesitate?

Well, rocks in the ocean, said, fish in the sea
Knows you mean the world to me
Tell me how long do I have to wait?
Can I get you now, Lord, must I hesitate?
    
Well, the hesitation stalker's got them hesitation shoes
You know, Lord, I got them hesitation blues
Tell me how long do I have to wait?
Can I get you now, Lord, must I hesitate?
Said, can I get you now, how long must I hesitate?
