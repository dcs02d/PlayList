    G                           C
    I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas,
    G                                      D
    It was a little place called Hamburger Dan's
    G                              C 
    And I heard that old jukebox a-playin',
    D                             G
    A song about a truck drivin' man
    
    Pour me another cup of coffee,
    For it is the best in the land
    I'll put a nickel in the jukebox,
    And play The Truck Drivin' Man
    
    The waitress just brought me some coffee
    I thanked her but called her again
    I said, "That ol' song sure does fit me
    'Cause I am a truck drivin' man"

    Pour me another cup of coffee,

    I'll put a nickel in the jukebox,
    And play The Truck Drivin' Man
    
    I climbed back on board my old semi
    And then like a flash I was gone
    I got them ol' truck wheels a-rollin
    I'm on my way to San Antone
    
    Pour me another cup of coffee,
    For it is the best in the land
    I'll put a nickel in the jukebox,
    And play The Truck Drivin' Man
    And play The Truck Drivin' Man
