I would shiver the whole night through.



My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm goin' where the cold wind blows.
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine,
I would shiver the whole night through.

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine,
I would shiver the whole night through.

My father was a hard workin' man
Killed a mile and a half from here.
His head was found in a driving wheel,
And his body hasn't ever been found.

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines
I would shiver the whole night through
