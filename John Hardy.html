    John Hardy was a desperate little man
    He carried two guns every day
    He shot down a man on that West Virginia line
    You ought a seen John Hardy getting away
    You ought to seen John Hardy getting away

    John Hardy stood in that old barroom
    So drunk that he could not see
    And a man walked up and took him by the arm
    He said Johnny, come and go along with me Poor boy
    Johnny, come and walk along with me

    John Hardy stood in his old jail cell
    The tears running down from his eyes
    He said I’ve been the death of many a poor boy
    But my six-shooters never told a lie
    No, my six-shooters never told a lie

    The first one to visit John Hardy in his cell
    Was a little girl dressed in blue
    She came down to that old jail cell
    She said Johnny, I’ve been true to you God knows
    Johnny, I’ve been true to you

    The next one to Visit John Hardy in his cell
    Was a little girl dressed in red
    She come down to that old jail cell
    She said, Johnny, I had rather see you dead
    Well, Johnny, I had rather see you dead

    I’ve been to the East and I’ve been to the West
    I’ve traveled this wide world around
    I’ve been to that river and I’ve been baptized
    So take me to my burying ground
    So take me to my burying ground

    John Hardy was a desperate little man
    He carried two guns every day
    He shot down a man on the West Virginia line
    You ought to seen old John Hardy getting away
    You ought to seen old John Hardy getting away
