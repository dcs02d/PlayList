    Am   C       D     Am       C      D       Am
    I hurt myself today   to see if I still feel
    C    D        Am        C      D          Am
    I focus on the pain   the only thing that's real
        C      D       Am         C      D       Am
    The needle tears a hole   the old familiar sting
        C      D      Am           C      D      G
    Try to kill it all away   but I remember everything

    Am              F     C               G
    What have I become?     My sweetest friend
    Am          F             C        G
    Everyone I know  goes away in the end
        Am                 F    G               G
    And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
    Am              F      G                Am
    I will let you down    I will make you hurt

    Am   C         D        Am        C      D       Am
    I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar's chair
    C       D        Am       C     D    Am
    Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
    C          D        Am         C       D       Am
    Beneath the stains of time   the feelings disappear
    C         D      Am    C     D           G
    You are someone else   I am still right here

    Am              F     C               G
    What have I become?     My sweetest friend
    Am          F             C        G
    Everyone I know  goes away in the end

    Am               F     G              G
    If I could start again  a million miles away
    Am              F    G
    I would keep myself  I would find a way
