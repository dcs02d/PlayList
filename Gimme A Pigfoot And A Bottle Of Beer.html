    [Intro, spoken]
    Twenty five cents? Ha! No-no,
    I wouldn't pay twenty-five cents to get into nowhere!
    Cuz'  listen here
   
    C7
    Up in Harlem every Saturday night
             F7                     F
    When the highbrows get together its just too tight
         G7                   Cm               C7
    They all congregate at an all night strut
    F                   A#
    And what they do is tut-tut-tut
    
    C7
    Ol' Hannah Brown, from cross town
    F7
    Gets full of corn and starts breaking 'em down
    F7
    And at the break of day
                            A#7
    You can hear ol' Hannah say
    
    
    [Chorus 1]
            D#
    Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer
    C7
    Send me again. I don't care
    F7                 A#7
    I feel just like I wanna clown
    D#                                         A#7         D#
    Give the piano player a drink because he's bringing me down!
    
    D#
    He's gotta rhythm, yeah! When he stomps his feet
       C7                           A#7
    He sends me right off to sleep
    D#             G7     C7
    Check all your razors and your guns
    C7                            F7    A#7     G#7
    We gonna be rasslin' when the wagon comes
