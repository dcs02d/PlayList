    I hear the train a comin'
    It's rollin' 'round the bend,
    And I ain't seen the sunshine
    Since, I don't know when
    I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
    And time keeps draggin' on
    But that train keeps a-rollin'
    On down to San Antone
    
    When I was just a baby
    My Mama told me, "Son
    Always be a good boy
    Don't ever play with guns, "
    But I shot a man in Reno
    Just to watch him die   
    When I hear that whistle blowin'        
    I hang my head and cry

    I bet there's rich folks eatin'
    In a fancy dining car
    They're probably drinkin' coffee
    And smokin' big cigars
    But I know I had it comin'
    I know I can't be free
    But those people keep a-movin'
    And that's what tortures me
    
    
    Well, if they freed me from this prison     
    If that railroad train was mine
    I bet I'd move out over a little
    Farther down the line
    Far from Folsom Prison
    That's where I want to stay
    And I'd let that lonesome whistle
    Blow my blues away
