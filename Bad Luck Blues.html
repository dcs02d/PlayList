    <h2>Bad Luck Blues</h2>

    Recorded by Blind Lemon Jefferson in 1926
    <br /><br />
    September 24, 1893 - December 19, 1929
    <br /><br />
    Jefferson died in Chicago at 10:00 a.m. on December 19, 1929, of what his death certificate said was "probably acute myocarditis".
    <br /><br />
    For many years, rumors circulated that a jealous lover had poisoned his coffee, but a more likely explanation is that he died of a heart 
    attack after becoming disoriented during a snowstorm. Some[who?] have said that he died of a heart attack after being attacked by a dog 
    in the middle of the night. 
    <br /><br />
    OR he was killed while being robbed of a large royalty payment by a guide escorting him to Chicago Union Station to catch a train 
    home to Texas. Paramount Records paid for the return of his body to Texas by train, accompanied by the pianist William Ezell.

I wanna go home and I ain't got sufficient clothes
Doggone my bad luck soul
Wanna go home and I ain't got sufficient clothes
I mean sufficient, talking about clothes
Well, I wanna go home, but I ain't got sufficient clothes

I bet my money and I lost it, Lord, it's so
Doggone my bad luck soul
Mm, lost it, ain't it so?
I mean lost it, speakin' about so, now
I'll never bet on the deuce-trey-queen no more

Mama, I can't gamble, son, why don't you quit tryin'?
Doggone my bad luck soul
Mmm, why don't you quit tryin'?
Why don't you quit, I mean tryin'?
That joker stole off with that long-haired brown of mine

Sugar, you catch the Katy, I'll catch that Santa Fe
Doggone my bad luck soul
Sugar, you catch that Katy and I'll catch that Santa Fe
I mean the Santy, speakin' about Fe
When you get in Denver, pretty mama, look around for me

The woman I love's 'bout five feet from the ground
Doggone my bad luck soul
Hey, five feet from the ground
Five feet from the, I mean ground
She's a tailor-made woman, she ain't no hand-me-down

I ain't seen my sugar in three long weeks today
Doggone my bad luck soul
I ain't seen my sugar, three long weeks today
Three long weeks to, I mean day, girl
It's been so long, seems like my heart's goin' break

I'm gonna run 'cross town, catch that southbound Santa Fe
Doggone my bad luck soul
Mm, Lord, that Santa Fe
I mean the Santy, speakin' about Fe
Be on my way to what they call lovin' Tennessee
