    D                         A
    Put your face up to the window
    G                          D
    Tell me all about your "gay folks"
    D                          A
    It feels better when you in it
    G                            D
    If your nervous use the pay phone
    
    Instrumental: D A G D
    
    Put your face where we can see it
    Put it on a show on cable
    You can really show it all there
    Turn it on when you are able

    Chorus:
    G
    Turn it on
    D
    Turn it on and all the way up
    G
    Turn it on
    D
    In your houses when you wake up
    G
    Turn it on
    D
    When you ain't got no relation
    A (Hold)
    To all those other stations
    D
    Turn it on
    
    Put your life into a bubble
    We can pick you up on radar
    "hit " a satelite with feeling
    Give the people what they paid for

    Chorus X 4
