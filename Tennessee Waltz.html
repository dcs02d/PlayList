I was waltzing with my darlin', to the Tennessee Waltz
        A                        E7
When an old friend I happened to see
       A
I introduced her to my loved one,
    A7              D
And while they were waltzing,
   A               E7              A
my friend stole my sweetheart from me.

    A           D&flat;7            D         A
I remember that night and the Tennessee Waltz,
                               E7
only you know  how much I have lost
       A                           A7              D
Yes, I lost my little darlin', the night they were playing,
     A         E7        A
that beautiful Tennessee Waltz.
