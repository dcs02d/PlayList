<!-- first column -->
<pre>            

    Gimme red lipstick and a bright purple rouge
    A shingle bob haircut and a shot of good booze
    Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' your horn
    If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone
    
    Come along young man, everything settin' right
    My husband's goin' away 'till next Saturday night
    Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
    If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone
    
    Now, I'm raring to go, got red shoes on my feet
    My mind is sittin' right for a Tin Lizzie seat
    Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
    If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone
    
    The red rooster said, "Cockle doodle do do"
    The Richards woman said, "Any dude will do"
    Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
    If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone

<!-- Second  column -->
<td><pre>

    With rosy red garters, pink hose on my feet
    Turkey red bloomer, with a rumble seat
    Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
    If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone
    
    Every Sunday mornin', church people watch me go
    My wings sprouted out and the preacher told me so
    Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
    If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone
    
    Dress skirt cut high, then they cut low
    Don't think I'm a sport, keep on watchin' me go
    Hurry down, sweet daddy, come blowin' you horn
    If you come too late, sweet mama will be gone
