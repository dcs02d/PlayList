    Oh I've loved you from afar, I've borne you like a scar,
    Sung your name across the bloody Colfiorito,
    But a poison took your heart, you charmless little tart,
    Now you've nary a jot o' bother at all for me-o,
    This old town has gone to bits, all the folk are off their tits,
    Screamin', "Hoo-rah! Hurry the fuck t'blazes!"
    A right parade o' fools come to stomp all o'er yer jewels,
    Like a fistful o' half dead roses.

    And we're here again, ho again, let the whisky flow again,
    Let the taps blow again, sound away the knell,
    Like a fistful o' roses, we'll take 'em to the grave,
    Every last tale there is to tell.

    Regular break / to short Am break

    Oh, this boozer is a wreck, all up & down the deck,
    Like a tired old sinner off her game,
    Wi' her blood red lips, and her youth about her hips,
    Still the regulars all love her just the same,

    Where the mud-spat boots cut their way among the suits,
    And the Sally's come to rattle the can for Jesus,
    'Til they chain up all the doors & toss out all the whores,
    Wi' a fistful o' half dead roses.
    
    
    May all the Autumn leaves turn to Twenties at yer feet,
    And the high & mighty come to know your thunder,
    We could set the world ablaze, but these are early days,
    And there's still a hell of a road for us tae wander,
    And there's one here among us'll outlive the rest,
    Take a tipple to his foibles & his praises,
    'Til they strike him off the roll & chuck him doon a hole,
    Wi' a fistful o' half dead roses.
