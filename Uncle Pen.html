    Oh the people would come from far away
                                    E7       A
    They'd dance all night till the break of day
     
    When the caller hollered do-se-do
                          E7       A
    We knew Uncle Pen was ready to go
    
    D                   A
    Late in the evening about sundown
                         E7        A
    High on the hill and above the town
          
    Uncle Pen played the fiddle and oh how it would ring
                                     E7      A
    You could hear it talk you could hear it sing

    Well he played an old tune called Soldier's Joy
    And the one they called Boston Boy
    And the greatest of all was Jenny Lind
    To me that's where the fiddlin' began
    
    Chorus
    
    I'll never forget that mournful day
    When Uncle Pen was called away
    They hang up his fiddle they hang up his bow
    They know it was time for him to go
    
    Chorus x2
