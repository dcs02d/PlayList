    Lord, I'm a li'l schoolboy, too


    Come on, be my baby
    Come on, be my baby
    I'll buy you a diamond

    If you don't like that, baby
    I ain't gon' buy ya a doggone thing


    I don't know, hardly
    I don't know, hardly
    What in this world

    I don't mean to hurt yo' feelings
    Or even get mad with you


    I'm gonna buy me an airplane
    I'm gonna buy me an airplane

    I'm gonna fly from town to town
    I don't find the girl I'm lovin
