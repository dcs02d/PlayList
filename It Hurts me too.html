    I can't be happy, mama, for being so blue
    When you keep on worrying the way you do
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you
    It hurts me too

    The man you loving, he don't want you 'round
    So take me mama, let's leave this town
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you
    It hurts me too

    If he keep on dolling you, the way you do
    I may lose my head mama, and my temper too
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you
    It hurts me too

</pre></td>
<!-- first column -->

<!-- Second  column -->
<td><pre>

    He wrecked your life mama, right at the start
    And if you ain't careful mama, he will break your heart
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you
    It hurts me too
    
    I love you baby, you know it's true
    So why put up mama, with the way you do
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you
    It hurts me too
    When things go wrong, so wrong with you
    It hurts me too
