    Cross country skiing down the red cedar river
    my coat’s too thin and I’m a bound to shiver
    The break a day the paper boy delivers and the headlines read that she ain’t no quitter
    She ain’t no quitter
    
    She’s got six kids and a sink full of dishes
    no man around to grant her wishes
    Yard’s a big mess and the neighbors complain 
    they call the cops every time that it rains
    She ain’t no quitter
    
    Life’s been hard baby there is no doubt
    that’s not what this song’s about 
    you should not judge a book by it’s cover
    it’s not fair to blame mother
    But don’t be so bitter
    
    The winter’s getting long and my money’s getting tight
    I slept all day and I drank all night
    I went down town and I started a fight
    I didn’t simmer down till I proved I was right
    I ain’t no kidder

    Well the whole next day I had no voice
    I didn’t wanna move but I had no choice
    I smoked got drink and I pushed again
    my voice came back around us 3 am
    I ain’t no quitter
    
    I sing my way till the morning gone
    looked around everybody was gone
    I tried to sleep but I did not succeed 
    so I got back up I put on my skis
    I ain’t no sitter
    
    I slipped on ice I skid through snow
    I speed my ass to Idaho 
    skied three weeks and I did not look back 
    all because of one a simple fact
    I ain’t no quitter
