    (D) Hold on honey I'd like to say
    I'm busting out and breaking away
    (G) I'm letting you go like a hot horse shoe
    I can't take another heartache (D) from you
    Think about how it's gonna be
    When you start back to needing me
    (G) When your dancing shoes have lost their shine
    I'm gonna be gone in (D) mine
    
    I'm leaving (G) now
    I'm leaving (D) now
    Get out of my (A) face
    Get out of my place
    I'm leaving now, adios
    I'm leaving (D) now
    
    And the time it comes when you trim the fat
    Feed the kitchen scraps to the front seat cat
    Bye bye baby when the bills come due
    You might have to give up a jewel or two
    Eat your heart out anyway
    It's hard as your head and it's cold as clay
    It's all over now you won't have me
    Your sugar daddy or your money tree

    I'm leaving now yeah
    I'm leaving now
    Get out of my space
    Get out of my face
    I'm leaving now, hey hey
    I'm leaving now
    
    Pull up the collar on my traveling coat
    Sell that miserable pleasure boat
    I wouldn't give a nickel for another buck
    I'm living on muscle, guts, and luck
    If anybody asks where did I go
    Tell 'em I went where the wild goose goes
    I wouldn't have me an area code
    Don't have a number, don't need a row
    
    I'm leaving now (me too)
    I'm leaving now
    Get out of my face
    Get out of my space
    I'm leaving now, adios
    I'm leaving now
