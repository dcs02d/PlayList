    <h2>Quit Me Blues</h2>

    Arthur Blake (1896 - December 1, 1934), known as Blind Blake, was an American blues and ragtime singer and guitarist. 
    He is known for numerous recordings he made for Paramount Records between 1926 and 1932. <br><BR>
    
    His final recording was at Paramount headquarters, in Grafton, Wisconsin, just before the label went out of business.<br>
    For decades nothing was known of him after this point, and it was rumored that he met with a violent death.<br>
    Reverend Gary Davis heard he had been hit by a streetcar in 1934. Big Bill Broonzy thought that he had frozen to death 
    after falling over drunk during a Chicago blizzard and was too overweight to get back up.
