    <h2>Key To the HIghway</h2>
    <h3>Blues in A</h3>

    "Key to the Highway" is a blues standard that has been performed and recorded by several blues and other artists. 
    Blues pianist Charlie Segar first recorded the song in 1940.<br>
    This is a version I adapted from what Big Bill Broonzy recorded 

    <Table border="2"><tr><td>

<!-- first column -->
<pre>            

    I got the key to the highway, and I'm billed out and bound to go
    I'm gonna leave here runnin', cause walkin' is most too slow
    
    I'm goin' down on the border, now where I'm better known
    Cause woman you don't do nothin', but drive a good man away from home
    
    Now when the moon creeps over the mountain, I'll be on my way
    Now I'm gonna walk this old highway, until the break of day

<!-- Second  column -->
<td><pre>

    Come here, sweet mama, now and help me with this heavy load
    I am due in West Texas, and I've got to get on the road

    I'm goin to West Texas, I'm going down
    I'm gonna ask the good Lord what evil have I done
