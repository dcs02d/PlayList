I got a [E] feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lawd
Since my baby said good-[B7] bye
And I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo
All I do is sit and [E] [P] sigh-igh, oh, Lawd
That [E7] last long [A] day she said good-[A7] bye
Well [E] Lawd I thought I would [C#7] cry
She'll [F#7] do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'
[B7] Lawd, I love to hear her when she calls me
Sweet [E] [P] dad-ad-ad-dy, [E] such a beautiful [B7] dream
I hate to think it all o-o-ver
I've lost my heart it [G#] seems

I've grown [A] so used to you some-[A7] how
Well, I'm [E] nobody's sugar-[C#7] daddy now
And I'm [F#7] lo-on-lonesome [B7]
I got the Lovesick [E] Blu-ues.

Well, I'm in [G#] love, I'm in love, [C#m] with a beautiful gal
[G#] That's what's the matter [C#m] with me
[G#] Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, [C#m]  with a beautiful gal
[F#] But she don't care about [B7] me
Lawd, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied
But she [E] just wouldn't stay
So [F#7] now that she is lea-eav-in'
This is all I can [B7] say. 

I got a [E] feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lawd
Since my baby said good-[B7] bye
I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo
I lost my heart it seems [G#] [P] sigh-igh, oh, Lawd

I've grown [A] so used to you some-[A7] how
Well, I'm [E] nobody's sugar-[C#7] daddy now
And I'm [F#7] lo-on-lonesome [B7]
