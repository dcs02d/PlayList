    Corrine, Corrina, where you been so long?
    I ain't been no loving since you been gone.
    Corrine, Corinna, where'd you stay last night?
    Corrine, Corinna, where'd you stay last night?
    Come in this morning, sun was shining bright.

    I met Corrina way across the sea,
    I met Corrina way across the sea,
    She wouldn't write no letter, she didn't care for me.

    Corrine, Corrina, what you're gonna do,
    Corrine, Corrina, what you're gonna do,
    Just a little bit of lovin' let your heart be true.
    I love Corrina, tell her what I do,
    I love Corrina, tell her what I do,
    Just a little bit of lovin' let your heart be true.

    Corrine, Corrina you're a pal of mine
    Corrine, Corrina you're a pal of mine
    Now she left me walkin', tears are rollin' and cryin'.
    Corrine, Corrina, what's the matter now?
    Corrine, Corrina, what's the matter now?
    You wouldn't write no letter, you didn't love me no how.

    Good-bye, Corrina, it's fare you well.
    Good-bye, Corrina, it's fare you well.
    When I'll came back, can't anyone tell.
