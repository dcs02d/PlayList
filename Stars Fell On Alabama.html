[Intro]
A F#m7 Bm7 E*

A   F#m7            Bm7     E*
We lived our little drama
A      Dmaj7         C#m7    F#7b9
We kissed in a field of white
Bm7       Bm7       E*
And stars fell on Alabama
 A      F#m7  Bm7  E*
Last night

A  F#m7            Bm7      E*
I can't forget the glamor
 A    Dmaj7         C#m7    F#7b9
Your eyes held a tender light
  Bm7    Bm7       E*
While stars fell on Alabama
 A       Dm7    A
Last night

F#7     Bm7         E*      C#m7    F#7
I never planned in my imagination
    Bm7 E*        A
A situation so heavenly
F#7     Bm7        E*             C#m7        F#7
A fairy land where no one else could enter
       D#m7  G#7            C#maj7     Bm7  E*
And in the center just you and me

A  F#m7              Bm7      E*
My heart beat like a hammer
A    Dmaj7            C#m7     F#7b9
My arms wound around you tight
Bm7   Bm7        E7
And stars fell on Alabama
 A      F#m7  Bm7  E*
Last night

F#7     Bm7         E*      C#m7    F#7
I never planned in my imagination
    Bm7 E*        A
A situation so heavenly

A fairy land where no one else could enter

And in the center just you and me, dear

A  F#m7              Bm7      E*
My heart beat like a hammer (hammer)
A    Dmaj7            C#m7     F#7b9
My arms wound around you tight
Bm7   Bm7        E*
And stars fell on Alabama
    A     Dmaj7 Dm7 A or Amaj7 to finish
Last....night
