    My old gal's a good old pal, and she looks like a water fowl
    When I get them deep river blues
    Ain't no one to cry for me, and the fish all go out on a spree
    When I get them deep river blues
    
    Give me back my old boat, I'm gonna sail if she'll float
    'Cause I got them deep river blues
    I'm goin' back to Muscle Shoals, times are better there I'm told        
    'Cause I got them deep river blues

    If my boat sinks with me, I'll go down, don't you see
    'Cause I got them deep river blues
    Now I'm gonna say goodbye, and if I sink, just let me die       
    'Cause I got them deep river blues
    
    Let it rain, let it pour, let it rain a whole lot more
