    <h2>Deep River Blues</h2>

    I'VE GOT THE BIG RIVER BLUES (1933) by the Delmore Brothers<br>
    Alton Delmore (December 25, 1908 - June 9, 1964)  and Rabon Delmore (December 3, 1916 - December 4, 1952) billed as The Delmore Brothers, were country 
    music pioneer singer-songwriters and musicians who were stars of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s.<br>
    Rabon died of lung cancer in 1952, a day after his 36th birthday. Following Rabon's death, Alton suffered a heart attack, 
    the loss of his father and his daughter Susan, all within a three-year period. He moved back to Huntsville, Alabama. He taught some guitar, 
    did odd jobs, and devoted his creative energies to writing prose. He wrote a series of short stories and his autobiography, Truth is Stranger than 
    Publicity, published posthumously in 1977 by the Country Music Foundation.

    My old gal's a good old pal, and she looks like a water fowl
    When I get them deep river blues
    Ain't no one to cry for me, and the fish all go out on a spree
    When I get them deep river blues
    
    Give me back my old boat, I'm gonna sail if she'll float
    'Cause I got them deep river blues
    I'm goin' back to Muscle Shoals, times are better there I'm told        
    'Cause I got them deep river blues
