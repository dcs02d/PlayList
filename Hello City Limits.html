Hello, city limits, -  I see your sign,

Left all - my wor-ries way - be-hind,
D        /    /        /    |/          /       /   / |
Left all - my troubles - and heartaches - there too,

Hello, city limits, I'm starting out brand new.
    
Fiddle Break 
    
I need a change of scenery, I need it real bad
To help me forget all the hard times I've had
Brian
I've got a feeling I'll find a love that's true
Well, hello city limits, I'm starting out brand new

Guitar Break

I haven't told a soul just where I'm gonna be
Cause I don't want the blues to catch up with me
Brian
I may decide to change my name too
Hello city limits, I'm starting out brand new
